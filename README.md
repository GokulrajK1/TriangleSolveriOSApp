# Triangle Solver iOS App 

## Description
Created using Xcode, Swift Storyboards, this is a triangle solver app that can accurately determine mathematical information regarding a triangle given at least three inputs (all three inputs cannot be angle measures). 
Input all the given values that you know and the solver will then display the information regarding that triangle. 

## Features 
- Can accurately calculate the remaining missing side lengths and angle measurements
- Can accurately calculate the area, perimeter, semiperimeter, medians, altitudes, inradius, and circumradius
- Can figure out whether two possible triangles exist and display information about both
- Can determine if given inputs can even form a triangle and detect when insufficient inputs are given
- Determine the type of triangle
- Can calculate angle measurements in degrees or radians
